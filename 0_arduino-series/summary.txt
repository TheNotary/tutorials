In this tutorial series, I explain how to do Arduino in a sophisticated manor.  
If you've done a couple Arduino projects so far and are wondering "Huh... so am I doing this right?" then you've come to the right tutorial series.   
By the end of this series, you will have a sophisticated development environment, 
you will know how to produce sophisticated code, and you will have had lots of fun doing it.
