================================================================
What if you want to work on a project with someone else on github?
=============


So let's say you want to collaborate with someone on github.  No worries, github makes that easy.  

1)  Fork a repo onto your github account

First thing's first, navigate to the project you'd like to collaborate on, and click the fork button (someone else must own the project).  


2)  Make a change that you think is swell

Just change some code... You could even do it from the html interface now.  


3)  Issue a pull request

You can now click the "pull request" button on your project page.  The other party will be alerted that you have made a swell change to the project.  They can then choose to either accept the change, or ignore it in the case that the change isn't swell enough.  





===============================================================
What if the other guy makes a change to his project after I've forked it?
==============

"Don't sweat it, this is no problem at all"

1)  Fetch the upstream changes and merge them (you need to work with things on a local machine, so set that up first)

[spoiler]
[code]
$  git clone git@github.com/YourAccount/ForkedRepo.git
$  cd ForkedRepo
[/code]
[/spoiler]

[code]
$  git remote add upstream git://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git

$  git fetch upstream

$  git merge upstream/master
[/code]


If you have problems, remember that git stash is your friend.  (TODO:  add link to git stash)
