Well, since we're setting up a debian system, we may as well review how to compile and run hello world.  We'll just think of this blog as a reference to look back at latter.  

The C++ compiler is already installed on debian.  It would be a little absurd for linux to not have one installed already.  
It's called g++, and you run it like this:

[code]
g++ hellosource.c
[/code]
and it will produce "a.out" in the directory from which it was run.  a.out is like your hello.exe, only for linux.  To run it, type:
[code]
./a.out
[/code]
nifty...

So lets write up some source code, compile it, and run it.  Then move on, cause we're not in the mood to build a c++ program atm.  

(hellosource.c)
[code]

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}


[/code]

Cool, make that file, and run the g++ compile command, and then run the file.  Then move on.  


Shoot... before we move on, we better compile the same thing in windows too, using an IDE.  

Doing that with code block is almost as easy, it just takes a little more time because you need to download the IDE.  

(Download the IDE/compiler)
[code]
codeblocks-10.05mingw-setup.exe:
http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26#windows
[/code]

Install it... then...
[code]
File-> new -> project
  SELECT "Console Application"
  CLICK "Go"

    CLICK "Next"
    
    CHOOSE "C++"
    CLICK "Next"
    
    (input project name and directory where project will be)
    CLICK "Next" 
    
    CHOOSE "GNU GCC Compiler"
    CLICK "Finish"
    
    
      Click the Play button in upper left of screen
        Exit the console window when you're done marvelling at the C++ application you built
        
      On the left of the screen, where the "Projects" tab is, maximize the tree nodes till you find main.cpp
        main.cpp is the windows name for hellosample.c
          double click it to view it's contents.  
[/code]      


OK, that was productive, now lets move on.
