Gem Building - Professionalizing Your Ruby Code 

Description:  

In this workshop style lesson, I'll walk you through my gem building workflow. 

Package management in general is an extremely valuable feature enabling software engineers the benefits of code re-usability, dependency tracking, locking down versions, and very snappy no-fuss deploys.

Join me as I walk through the process of extracting functionality out of a large ruby app, tucking the important functionality into it's own gem. Not only will this make my code more accessible in future projects, but it will also shrink down the size of my larger project.
